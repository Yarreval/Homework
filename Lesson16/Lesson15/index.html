					<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<sup>Chapter 1</sup></h2>
					<p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
						instructions, they've moved to <span class="underline">their own section</span>. Continue reading for an
						introduction to the
						documentation,
						Native Components, React, and more!</p>

					<p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app
						platform&#8217;s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform&#8217;s APIs as well as
						to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="italic">bundles of
							reusable,
							nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let&#8217;s cover how
						components
						work in React Native.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="chapter chapter3">
					<div class="black_border"></div>
					<h2 id="react">react fundamentals<sup>Chapter 3</sup></h2>
					<p>React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open source library for building user
						interfaces with JavaScript. To
						make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can
						serve as a refresher course.</p>
					<p>We&#8217;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
					<p><span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples:
						friendly, approachable
						creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
					<p class="first_pb"><span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
						inside JavaScript like so: <br> <span class="gray_bg">
							&#60;Text&#62;Hello, I am your cat!&#60;/Text&#62;</span>.
					</p>
					<p class="second_pb">The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even
						more. Because JSX is
						JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="gray_bg">name</span> for
						the cat, name, and embedding
						it with curly braces inside <span class="gray_bg">&#60;Text&#62;</span></p>
					<p><span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
					<p class="four_pb"><span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
						components render, state is
						like a component&#8217;s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
						comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

				<div class="chapter chapter4">
					<div class="black_border"></div>
					<h2 id="handling">handling text input<sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>
					<p class="third_pb">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
							class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a
						function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be
						called when the text is submitted.</p>
					<p >For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In
						this new language, every single word is written the same way: <span class="pizza">üçï</span>. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
						translated as "<span class="pizza">üçï üçï</span>.</p>
